# Dragon-Fall
A small game I created in my senior year of high school and later cleaned up. Created using Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) 
and Pygame (https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

If you don't want to go through the hassle of downloading a new language, I've included a demo video.

Special thanks to Mr. Traughber!
